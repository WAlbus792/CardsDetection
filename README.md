# Playing cards detection AI build with Python(Tensorflow) + C#
###
This readme describes the steps required to get going with your own object detection classifier:
1. Train the model with necessary images (see [Trainer](Trainer/research/object_detection/README.md))
2. After sufficient training of the model need to run C# application to detect cards (see [Detector](Detector/README.md))
